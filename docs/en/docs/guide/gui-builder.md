:::warning
At present, the visual scaffolding is in the alpha stage, and its function is relatively simple, and it is only used for tasting. Welcome to [GitHub](https://github.com/vuepress-reco/revili-kit-vuepress-reco/issues) puts forward some valuable suggestions.

There is still a certain threshold for the use of themes. In order to facilitate beginners, especially non-front-end developers, reco theme try to build a visual platform based on [revili](https://revili.recoluan.com/).

```bash
# global installation of revili
pnpm add -g revili@next

# install the reco theme kit
revili add revili-kit-vuepress-reco@next

# launch a visual platform
revili start
```
